### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Ritual Template Generation
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

   - Preferred activities/settings
   - Emotional state/goals for the ritual
   - Time constraints
   - Personal preferences
3. AI generates 2-3 personalized ritual templates
4. User can customize, save, or regenerate options

**Benefits:**
- Personalized content based on individual grief journey
- Reduces decision fatigue during difficult times
- Provides inspiration when users feel stuck
- Learns from user preferences over time

**Requirements:**
